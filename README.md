# OpenServo

This is an open hardware project I started back around 2006 to create a circuit board
that implements digital control of inexpensive hobby-level analog servos.  Utilizing
AVR microcontrollers and the I2C bus, these circuit boards offered superior control
and feedback over simple PWM control of small hobby servos.  This project has since
been taken over by Barry Carter who now maintains the code and the web site at
www.openservo.org.
